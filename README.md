# Random Color Generator

## Description:

A program that generates random colors depending on user input

- If a user types in a specific command, a block of approximately 31x9 # characters and a random color (using hex code) will be generated.
- The program also accepts requests for hue and luminosity and then generates random colors that match those choices.
- If a user types "ask" instead of a color name, it prints questions to ask the user for the name of the color and the luminosity.
- If a user types a size in the format of WWxHH (eg. 31x9) before the color and luminosity, it will use this as the size of the box.
